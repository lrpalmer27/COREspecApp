type cd 'new current dir here'

from cmd type "pyinstaller 'path to python file here'"

this creates a 'dist' folder in the running location

Add req'd dependencies to run to folder (just common stuff like pics and database)

put the installer in a zip folder

use NSIS installer to create an installer pkg that installs the zip file somewhere
